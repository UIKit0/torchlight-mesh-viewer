- you can associate .mesh files to TLMeshViewer.exe
- you can drap&drop .mesh file into viewer or just use File/open..
- it should support animations as well
if you have problem running it, please tell me. You may need DX august 2009 redist (needed to run Ogre 1.7.x) - this you'll need also to run TL2.
